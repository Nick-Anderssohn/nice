# Build Nice from source and install it into /Applications so it behaves
# like any other Mac app — Spotlight, Launchpad, Dock, login items.
#
# Two variants:
#   default (no flag)  → `Nice Dev` (dev.nickanderssohn.nice-dev) into
#                        /Applications/Nice Dev.app, built in ./build-dev.
#                        Fully isolated from the user's real Nice: its
#                        own UserDefaults domain, its own Application
#                        Support folder, its own install bundle. Safe
#                        default — rebuilding does not touch the user's
#                        live `/Applications/Nice.app` sessions.
#
#   --prod             → `Nice` (dev.nickanderssohn.nice) into
#                        /Applications/Nice.app, built in ./build. The
#                        production install, used for real work. Leaves
#                        any running Nice untouched — the bundle on
#                        disk is swapped in place via staged rename,
#                        and the running process picks up the new
#                        version on next relaunch, so long-lived
#                        Claude Code sessions hosted in the current
#                        Nice survive the upgrade. Run only when the
#                        user explicitly asked to upgrade prod.
#
# Idempotent: re-running upgrades in place. Dev installs quit a
# running `Nice Dev` first so the next launch picks up the new build;
# prod installs never quit the running app. User state lives in
# UserDefaults outside the bundle, so settings survive an upgrade.
#
# Requires: Xcode (full IDE, not just Command Line Tools), xcodegen,
# macOS 14+. xcodegen can be installed via `brew install xcodegen` or any
# other route that puts it on PATH.
#
# Acquire the worktree lock before calling this script. The lock is
# load-bearing for two reasons:
#   1. /Applications/<variant>.app and project.yml are shared mutable
#      state across worktrees and concurrent install runs.
#   2. The crash-recovery dotfile .scripts-project-yml.bak is a single
#      shared path within a worktree (also read by test.sh). Two
#      uncoordinated runs could overwrite each other's backup with an
#      already-patched file and bake the patch in permanently.
# See the `worktree-lock` skill / CLAUDE.md.
#
# project.yml is restored on exit. If the script is killed before the
# EXIT trap fires (kill -9, parent shell killed mid-script, power
# loss), the next invocation finds the stale backup and restores from
# it before doing anything else.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  installed
#   1  prereq missing
#   2  build or install step failed

# package dependency, which breaks its resource bundle. The anchored

# returns project.yml to whatever the developer had before the
# crashed run started. --prod also runs this even though it doesn't
# patch — without recovery here, a stale dev-variant patch left on
# disk would silently make us build the dev bundle ID and install it
# as Nice.app.
#
# Guards:
#   - require non-empty backup. A truncated/zero-byte backup (left by
#     a hypothetical mid-`cp` interruption, or external truncation)

#   - skip the restore entirely when backup contents already match
#     project.yml. Catches the case where the developer noticed the
#     bad state and `git restore`d the file themselves but didn't
